##### A graphic exercise

# About the project
##### c programing - low-level graphic programing

# How to use
<sub>first step: compilation with a Makefile</sub>

<sub>use ```make```</sub>

<sub>second step: run the program</sub>

<sub>use ```./fractol``` </sub>

# Go further
<sub>This very complete program lack optimisation</sub>
<sub>The first improvement should be a multithreading managment for the calculation of the fractal</sub>
